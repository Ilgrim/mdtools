This repository contains a collection of several free tools designed to aid
in development of Mega Drive homebrew. The objective is to make it easier to
build better quality homebrew as well as to provide a standard set of tools.

Excuse the fact there isn't much here for the moment. We hope we can add many
more useful tools later :O)
